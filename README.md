This repository contains the full project pipelie for fabric defect detection system, developed as part of an MSc in Data Science research project. The system compares traditional Machine Learning (SVM) with Deep Learning (YOLOv8, YOLOv11) approaches to identify defects in textile fabrics in real-time.

## 📌 Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop a computer vision solution capable of detecting fabric defects (e.g., holes, stains, yarn misalignments) on industrial production lines. The study addresses the challenge of **Class Imbalance** (a 3:1 ratio of normal to defective samples) using a physical Random Oversampling strategy.

**Key Features:**
* **Baseline Model:** Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) + Linear SVM.
* **Deep Learning Models:** YOLOv8n, YOLOv8s, and YOLOv11n.
* **Data Optimization:** Random oversampling to balance the dataset.
* **Performance:** The optimal model (**YOLOv8n**) achieves **68.3% Recall** and **85.7% Precision**.
